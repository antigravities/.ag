# `.ag`
My puny dotfiles, because I'm a lightweight.

You may or may not want to use these files, but I put them here to keep them synchronized between my PCs and maybe - just maybe - as a template for other dotfiles.

I use `bash`, and this script is intended to be executed at the bottom of your `.bashrc` file like this: `source ~/.ag`

`.ag` implies that you have `git` and `curl` installed for the purposes of pushing saved changes and updating.
